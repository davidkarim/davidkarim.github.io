I am a professional with over 20 years of experience in the field of tech and telecommunications. I focus primarily on Software Deployment Automation, AWS Cloud Solutions, application of DevOps processes, Web3, and AI applications.

On the Cloud side, I have the bulk of my expertise on Amazon Web Services, but I have worked on other cloud providers such as Google Cloud Platform, Oracle Cloud, and Digital Ocean.

I have also worked on Web3 infrastructure focused on implementing automated deployments of Web3 nodes to support numerous chains such as Ethereum, Solana, BSC, and others. I have also worked with Smart Contracts across these chains.

Finally, I have worked on several projects involving Artificial Intelligence Agents. AI Agents have the potential to provide more sophisticated tools for medium and small businesses. Tools traditionally only available to large enterprises, such as chat bots, automated call attendants, automated marketing campaigns, and internal knowledge base queries are now more accessible.
