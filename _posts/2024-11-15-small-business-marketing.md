Palmetto Dentist is a small business located in Boca Raton, Florida which specializes in dental implants and other dental services. I worked on their site, which serves mostly as a marketing presence and a landing page for occasional marketing campaigns. 

I elected to host the site on AWS LightSail due to the low cost that it provides.

I used a templating app called Mobirise to help with the layout and then finished off the HTML by hand. I have also added several integrations with the Dental Office management platform to help schedule patients through the site directly.
