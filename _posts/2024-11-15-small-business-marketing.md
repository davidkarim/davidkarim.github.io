Palmetto Dentist is a small business located in Boca Raton, Florida which specializes in dental implants and other dental services. I worked on their site, which serves mostly as a marketing presence and a landing page for occasional marketing campaigns. 

I elected to host the site on AWS LightSail due to the low cost that it provides.

Once the church was satisfied with the new site, we had the provider update the DNS to make the site go live. The new site implements features such as a Calendar of Events, announcements banner, and a background video which I recorded using a DJI drone.
