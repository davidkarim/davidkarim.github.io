## tenv will replace the others

When using Terraform, it’s common to rely on a version manager to easily switch between different versions across projects or environments. For years, **tfenv** has been the go-to solution in the community. But with the tool seeing little to no active development lately, it might be time to consider more modern alternatives.

Two other tools worth evaluating are **tfswitch**, a popular option with a user-friendly interactive mode, and the newer **tenv**, which is quickly gaining traction—especially for teams also adopting **OpenTofu**, the open-source Terraform fork.

Developed as part of the <a href="https://github.com/tofuutils" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tofuutils</a> project, tenv is a Terraform and OpenTofu version manager that was created with today’s infrastructure workflows in mind. It provides the same core functionality you’d expect—installing, switching, and managing versions—but with native support for **both Terraform and OpenTofu**.

As HashiCorp’s licensing change prompted a surge of interest in OpenTofu, having a version manager that treats both tools as first-class citizens is a major advantage.
