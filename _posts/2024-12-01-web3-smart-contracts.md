Boca Contracts is a platform that allows anyone to deploy Web3 Smart Contracts based on a set of pre-defined templates. Anyone visiting the site can deploy a smart contract to any of several blockchains.

Boca Contracts is a NextJS application that is deployed on AWS via terraform. It is composed of EC2 instances, load balancers, and an RDS database.

Once the church was satisfied with the new site, we had the provider update the DNS to make the site go live. The new site implements features such as a Calendar of Events, announcements banner, and a background video which I recorded using a DJI drone.
